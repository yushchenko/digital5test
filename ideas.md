# Digital 5 Test, a rainy weekend.

## From yesterday's G+

* Several answers for a question - memory vs processor.
* Code Review of the questions itself.
* Use JavaScript instead of C#.
* Thanks for fun.
* Use bright colours (markers).
* Send this log with the pictures.
* Create micro project in Git repository.

## 1. Fibonacci Sequence, C#, performance (no reqursion)

I used to know C# but now JavaScript seems better for me to play with algorithms.

Use http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/.
Check performance in http://jsperf.com/, provide sample URL's.
http://jsperf.com/fibonacii-numbers-for-digital5-test

Write down only one sample, replace C# function definition with JavaScript one.
